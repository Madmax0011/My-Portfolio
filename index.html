                I have a keen interest in AI and ML as well as handling and analyzing data using large-scale distributed
                systems. My projects include developing a face alignment system using deep learning, creating
                a strategic game using the Godot Engine, building a Spotify clone and many more.
                Additionally, I am actively learning the MERN Stack and working on projects related to
                cloud infrastructure and machine learning.

                My career aspiration is to contribute to innovative projects that enhance user experiences and
                make a positive impact on society. I am eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to solve
                complex problems and work with cutting-edge technologies.
